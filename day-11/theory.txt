HTML Entities
HTML entities are a crucial part of HTML markup language. They enable you to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. 

What Are HTML Entities?
HTML entities are used to represent special characters in a format that the browser can understand. They start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;).

Why Use HTML Entities?
Here are some reasons:

Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
Special Symbols: For symbols like ©, ®, or mathematical symbols.
Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line.

&lt;  for <
&gt;  for >
&amp; for &
&nbsp; for a non-breaking space
&copy; for ©
 

 HTML Quotation Tag
The use of quotations is common in textual content. HTML provides specific tags to handle this: <blockquote> for block quotations and <q> for inline quotations. 
What Are <blockquote> and <q> Tags?
The <blockquote> and <q> tags serve to define quotations in HTML. While <blockquote> is used for longer, block-level quotes, <q> is used for shorter, inline quotes.

Why Use These Tags?
They provide semantic meaning to your quotations, making it easier for search engines to understand the context and relevance of the content.

Attributes
Both <blockquote> and <q> tags support the cite attribute:

cite: Specifies the URL of the quote's source.
