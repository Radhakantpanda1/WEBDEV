It's my first day of tarting webdev and today I learnt about how websites work .
HTML forms the skeleton of website which is styled using CSS and functionality is provided using JAVASCRIPT.
The client searches for information on browser and the browser requests the corresponding sever for the information which includes images ,videos and a lot.
The browser downloads the HTML CSS JS and other files and renders them and shows the result to the client. 
The CSS is extenally linked to the HTML file via <link rel="stylesheet" href="#">(written inside head tag) .This establishes a relationship/link  between the HTML and the corresponding CSS.
The JS is extenally linked to the HTML file via <script src="./script.js"></script> (written inside the body tag at the end).This establishes a relationship/link  between the HTML and the corresponding JS.
